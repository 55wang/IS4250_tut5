```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(foreign)
library(ggplot2)
cty122 = read.spss("/Users/wang/IS4250_tut5/country122.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE)

model <- lm(lifeexpf ~ birthrat, data=cty122)
cor.test(cty122$lifeexpf, cty122$birthrat)
summary(model)

```
It has a strong negative correlation between life expectancy and birth rate. The p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
predict(model, data.frame(birthrat=25))

ggplot(cty122, aes(x=birthrat, y=lifeexpf)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)
```
The assumption is that there is correlation between lifeexpf and birthrat.
But this does not imply there is casuation.
